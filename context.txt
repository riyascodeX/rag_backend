The American CollegePROSPECTUS 2019 - 2019
The American College is one of the institutions in higher education known for 
its focus on academic excellence and social relevance. Its pioneering role in the 
development of college autonomy in India, its successful beginning of Choice 
Based Credit System and its completion of 137 years of higher education bear 
testimony to the position that the college currently enjoys. Originally founded 
by American Missionaries in 1841, the American College grew into a collegiate 
department in 1881. Earlier, it was affiliated to the University of Madras and later, 
it came under the jurisdiction of Madurai Kamaraj University. With its extreme 
sensitivity to national policies and community needs, the college has grown from 
strength to strength. It is one of the first set of seven colleges to be made autonomous 
by the UGC in 1977-1978. Today, the college offers thirty one undergraduate and seventeen postgraduate 
programmes. There are research centres offering M.Phil., and Ph.D Programmes in various disciplines. 
There are other autonomous centres like Department of Applied Sciences (DAS) and Study Centre for 
Indian Literature in English and Translation (SCILET) that receive national and international attention. Its 
alumni shine as luminaries internationally as scientists, intellectuals, administrators, corporate managers, 
statesmen, and leaders. The college has active theatre groups, National Service Scheme and N.C.C. units 
that offer students a wide range of opportunities to serve society. These activities add up to make the 
campus vibrant for developing one’s personality. The college has many tie-ups with many state, central 
and private industries and institutes. An MoU between the American College and Concordia College, New 
York enables the second year UG students of select departments to complete their degrees at Concordia 
College under American Transfer Programme (ATP).
